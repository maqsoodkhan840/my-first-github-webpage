          I am a 5th-semester Computer Science student exploring AI, ML and Data
          Science. I love coding and problem-solving. I am currently learning
          web development and GitHub. I enjoy creating projects that challenge
          my skills and expand my knowledge. I am also interested in open-source
          contributions and collaborating with other developers. I believe in
          the power of technology to make a positive impact on the world. I am
          excited to learn more about AI and its applications in various fields.
